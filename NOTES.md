Things to do before ipv3 release

# Issues Noticed

-   `ip!space channels` will show the message to space channels automatically
    even after it is enabled.

# Still TODO

-   Testing
-   All of Settings

# New Features (only some must be implemented)

Suggestion: ip!sticky message | message url

-   Stickies a message to the botom of the channel
-   Every time a message is sent, the sticky is re-sent
-   Optionally sticky with message link instead of id

Suggestion: ip!channels writeonly #channel -> #admin channel

-   Messages instantly deleted
-   Optionally, has a code so you can PM messages to the bot if you don't want
    other users to see it
-   Result messages are posted in a specified channel

Suggestion: path(route, ...handlers)

Suggestion: ip!send #channel "message" {richembed}

-   Requires @ everyone permissions
-   Requires manage guild permissions
-   optionally send with a custom username, requiring that the bot has create
    webhook permissions

Suggestion: ip!portal messagelink -> messagelink

-   Creates a portal between two channels/servers
-   IP must be in both
-   Sender must be in both
-   Requires manage guild permissions on result server (and initial server?)
-   Deleted messages are deleted also
-   Edited messages are edited also
-   Optionally create a two-way portal ip!portal messagelink <-> messagelink
-   Requires manage guild permissions on both servers

Suggestion: ip!alias command alias

-   Creates an alias to a command

Suggestion: ip!commands add "[commandname]" [type: interactive|random] Also:
ip!quote replies There is no quote command on this server. Create one with
ip!commands add "quote" interactive

-   ip!lists add "commandname'
-   "React to any message with :heavy_plus_sign: to add to the list or
    :bangbang: to add it to the list including author and message link "
-   React :success_2: to finish. Message contains a summary of changes

Major Suggestion: ip!edit server

-   Sends you a PM with a link !!FOR YOU ONLY!! to make changes to your server
-   Edit channel names, move channels, edit role names, move roles, create
    channels/roles, delete channels/roles
-   Save button shows a summary of changes and warns for deleting channels with
    lots of messages, recommending creating an archive channel instead
-   Channel names can include spaces
-   Category names can include lowercase letters with a checkbox but a warning
    will be shown that lowercase letters may not show on all devices
-   Channel names can include lowercase letters with a checkbox but the same
    warning will be shown along with another one saying that to mention a
    channel with lowercase letters you need to type <#channel id> or scroll
    through the list

Suggestion: Roles only some people can mention

Suggestion: ip!invite link tracking

-   Tracks who joins on invite links and how many people
-   Sometimes there are conflicts. Keeps track of how many conflicts there were
    (multiple people joining at once)
-   Optionally announce on join messages (using invite link {invite link})

Suggestion: ip!stats onlinemembers #channelname|id "Online Members: {count}'

-   Puts the server member count in that channel name

Suggestion: https://interpunct.info/

-   Costs \$80/yr so using https://interpunct.info/ instead

Suggestion: When a command message is deleted, have the bot delete its reply
also

-   Only on success/failure
-   Store in a seperate table linking messagee id to bot message id

More about Invite Link Tracking:

-   Name invite links?
-   For example, on this server I'll have a seperate invite link for each
    section on the website
